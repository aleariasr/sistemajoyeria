# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js storefront application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` version 1.3.1 using pnpm
- Package added to dependencies in `package.json`

### 2. Root Layout Update (src/app/layout.tsx)
- Imported `SpeedInsights` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/next`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after the `<Providers>` wrapper
- Placement ensures it's globally available across all pages

## Implementation Details

**Next.js Version**: 14.2.18 (App Router)

Since this project uses Next.js 14.2.18 with App Router (which is newer than 13.5), I used the recommended approach:
- Import from `@vercel/speed-insights/next`
- Component placed directly in the root layout
- No need for client directive or manual route passing

**Files Modified**:
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added SpeedInsights import and component
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` - Generated lock file with dependencies

## Verification

✅ **Build**: Production build completed successfully
✅ **Linting**: No new linting errors introduced (only pre-existing warning in CategoryCatalogContent.tsx)
✅ **Tests**: All 52 tests pass (3 test suites)

## Notes

- The SpeedInsights component is placed after the Providers wrapper but still inside the body tag
- This component will automatically track Web Vitals and send data to Vercel when deployed
- No additional configuration is required for basic functionality
- The component will only be active in production environments on Vercel
